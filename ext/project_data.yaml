summary: 'Razor is an advanced provisioning application'
description: |
  Razor is an advanced provisioning application which can deploy both bare-metal
  and virtual systems. It's aimed at solving the problem of how to bring new
  metal into a state where your existing DevOps/configuration management
  workflows can take it over.

  Newly added machines in a Razor deployment will PXE-boot from a special Razor
  Microkernel image, then check in, provide Razor with inventory information, and
  wait for further instructions. Razor will consult user-created policy rules to
  choose which preconfigured model to apply to a new node, which will begin to
  follow the model's directions, giving feedback to Razor as it completes various
  steps. Models can include steps for handoff to a DevOps system such as Puppet
  or to any other system capable of controlling the node (such as a vCenter
  server taking possession of ESX systems).
