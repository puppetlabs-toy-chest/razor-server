class Razor::Command::DeletePolicy < Razor::Command
  summary "Deletes a policy from Razor so that it no longer matches new nodes."
  description <<-EOT
Deletes a single policy, removing it from Razor.  This will work regardless of
the number of nodes bound to that policy. Any node that has previously installed will
remain "installed", and will not be matched to by another policy.

  example <<-EOT
To delete the policy so that it is "obsolete":

    {"name": "obsolete"}
