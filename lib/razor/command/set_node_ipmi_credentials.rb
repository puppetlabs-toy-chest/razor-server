class Razor::Command::SetNodeIPMICredentials < Razor::Command
  summary "Sets the IPMI host and credentials for a node."
  description <<-EOT
Razor can store IPMI credentials on a per-node basis.  These are the hostname
(or IP address), the username, and the password to use when contacting the
BMC/LOM/IPMI lan or lanplus service to check or update power state and other
node data.

This is an atomic operation. All three data items are set or reset in a single
operation.  Partial updates must be handled client-side.  Doing so eliminates
conflicting update and partial update combination surprises for users.

As with the IPMI authentication standard, both username and password are
optional. The system will work with either or both absent.

      "name":          "node17",
      "ipmi-hostname": "bmc17.example.com",
      "ipmi-username": null,
      "ipmi-password": "sekretskwirrl"
    }
