  summary "Create a new broker configuration for hand-off of installed nodes"
  description <<-EOT
Create a new broker configuration.  Brokers are responsible for handing a node
off to a config management system, such as Puppet or Chef.  In cases where you
have no configuration management system, you can use the `noop` broker.
  EOT

  example <<-EOT
Creating a simple Puppet broker:

    {
      "name": "puppet",
      "configuration": {
         "server":      "puppet.example.org",
         "environment": "production"
      },
      "broker-type": "puppet"
    }

                 help: _(<<-HELP)
    The name of the broker, as it will be referenced within Razor.
    This is the name that you supply to, eg, `create-policy` to specify
    which broker the node will be handed off via after installation.

  attr 'broker-type', type: String, references: [Razor::BrokerType, :name],
                      help: _(<<-HELP)
    The broker type that this broker is created from.  The available
    broker types on your server are:
    #{Razor::BrokerType.all.map{|n| "     - #{n}" }.join("\n")}
  HELP

  object 'configuration', help: _(<<-HELP) do
    The configuration for the broker.  The acceptable values here are
    determined by the `broker-type` selected.  In general this has
    settings like which server to contact, and other configuration
    related to handing on the newly installed system to the final
    configuration management system.
