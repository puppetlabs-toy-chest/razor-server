  # How to match nodes to possibly existing nodes in the database. The node
  # sends us the MAC addresses of its network interfaces, serial number,
  # asset tag, and UUID. We consider two nodes to be the same if they agree
  # on any of the values named in the array +match_nodes_on+. Array entries
  # can be any of 'mac', 'serial', 'asset', or 'uuid', in any order.
  #
  # Note that if you have nodes that have dummy values for one of these,
  # e.g. that all have an asset tag of 'No asset tag' and +match_nodes_on+
  # contains 'asset', all these nodes will be assumed to be the
  # same. Better yet: make sure that +match_nodes_on+ does not contain
  # 'asset' in that situation
  #
  # By default, we only match on MAC's, which is generally safe, but will
  # cause trouble if the NIC's in a node are ever completely
  # replaced. Consider adding one of the other possible values, e.g. 'uuid'
  # to the array
