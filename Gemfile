# For the sake of RVM, this overrides the engine line below, which is too
# complicated for the simple shell parser to handle.  This ensures that RVM
# users get something at least vaguely sane out of the box.  (Which is really
# in the realm of 'developer courtesy settings', not production support.)
#
# If you prefer to override these choices with something more explicit, you
# can use the `.ruby-version` and `.ruby-gemset` files in your local checkout
# to take precedence over what is defined here.
#
# You should aim for jruby-1.7.4, since that is what is bundled into TorqueBox
# at the present time, so better to learn about bugs early, no?
#
# Note that the lack of whitespace matters in those two lines:
#ruby=jruby-1.7.8
#ruby-gemset=razor-server
