    # This code finds the `boot.cfg` file in the repository, parses it, and
    # makes a set of modifications intended to make it net-boot from Razor.
    #
    # I chose this path because the boot.cfg file varies between releases of
    # ESXi (such as 5.0 to 5.5), and could quite legitimately vary between
    # smaller jumps than that -- after all, it is inside their boot loader,
    # and they can change the construction of the installer CD without
    # breaking anything...
    #
    # The alternative was to copy in the boot.cfg, modify it the way this code
    # will do on the fly, and then use that.  That is actually the exact
    # process documented for setting up ESXi PXE boot -- statically make this
    # change -- too.
    #
    # Given the changes are purely mechanical and well understood, this will
    # do for the majority of cases without the risk / cost that a slight
    # variant in the CD breaks everything, I think. --daniel 2013-10-14
