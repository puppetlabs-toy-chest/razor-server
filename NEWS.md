# Razor Server Release Notes

+ "installers" are renamed to "recipes" across the board
  + this reflects their ability to do more than just install things

## 0.11.0 - 2013-11-26

### Public API changes
+ include the installer and broker in the policy detail
+ include the name of the base installer in the installer details
+ new commands enable-policy and disable-policy
+ new commands delete-tag and update-tag-rule

### Installers
+ add installer for ESXi 5.5
+ add installer for Windows 8; details are on the
  [Wiki](https://github.com/puppetlabs/razor-server/wiki/Installing-windows)
+ Debian
  + support the new Debian 7.2 multiarch netboot CD, which includes and
  i386 and an amd64 kernel
+ RHEL
  + properly set the BOOTIF argument; before kickstart could fail if a
    machine had multiple NICs because of this
  + use `/etc/rc.d/rc.local`, not `/etc/rc.local` in the post install
    script; the latter is simply a symlink and making changes to that will
    not be seen by the init scripts
+ Ubuntu
  + Improved Precise (12.04 LTS) installer

### Node/server API changes
+ the `broker_install_url` helper now fetches the broker install script;
  the stock insallers now run the broker install script
+ the `file_url` helper now supports fetching raw files, not just
  interpolated templates
+ the `/svc/nodeid` endpoint makes it possible for nodes to look up their
  Razor-internal node id from their hardware information

### Configuration
+ validate various aspects of the server configuration on startup
+ updated `facts.blacklist` in `config.yaml.sample`
+ new setting `match_nodes_on` to select which hardware attributes to
  match on when identifying a node. Defaults to `mac`

### Other
+ support repos that are merely references to content hosted somewhere else
  in addition to repos created by importing an ISO
+ update to Sinatra 1.4.4; this fixes an issue where ipxe would take a
  very long time downloading kernels and initrd's
+ all logging goes through Torquebox's logging subsystem now. See
  [the logging docs](https://github.com/puppetlabs/razor-server/blob/master/doc/logging.md) for details
+ upgrade to Torquebox 3.0.1 and jRuby 1.7.8
+ lots of bug fixes and minor improvements
