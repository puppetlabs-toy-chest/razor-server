# Razor server

Razor is an advanced provisioning application which can deploy both
bare-metal and virtual systems. It's aimed at solving the problem of how to
bring new metal into a state where your existing DevOps/configuration
management workflows can take it over.

Newly added machines in a Razor deployment will PXE-boot from a special Razor
Microkernel image, then check in, provide Razor with inventory information,
and wait for further instructions. Razor will consult user-created policy
rules to choose which recipes to apply to a new node, which will begin to
follow the task directions, giving feedback to Razor as it completes various
steps. Tasks can include steps for handoff to a DevOps system such as
[Puppet](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet) or to any other system capable
of controlling the node (such as a vCenter server taking possession of ESX
systems).

***

This is a [0.x release](http://semvber.org); that means that we might make
backwards incompatible changes, especially to the database schema which
would force you to rebuild all the machines that Razor is managing. The
current code base is perfectly suitable for evaluation and smaller lab
setups but not for production use.

## What does Razor do anyway ?

Razor is a power control, provisioning, and management application designed
to deploy both bare-metal and virtual computer resources. Razor provides
broker plugins for integration with third party configuration systems such
as Puppet.

Razor does this by discovering new nodes using
[facter](https://github.com/puppetlabs/facter), tagging nodes using facts
based on user-supplied rules and deciding what to install through matching
tags to user-supplied policies. Installation itself is handled flexibly
through ERB templating all installer files. Once installation completes,
the node can be handed off to a broker, typically a configuration
management system. Razor makes this handoff seamless and flexible.

## Razor MicroKernel

The [MicroKernel](https://github.com/puppetlabs/razor-el-mk) is a small OS
image that Razor boots on new nodes to do discovery. It periodically
submits [facts](https://github.com/puppetlabs/facter) about the node and
waits for instructions from the server about what to do next, if anything.

A [prebuilt archive](http://links.puppetlabs.com/razor-microkernel-latest.tar)
is available.

## Razor Client

The [Client](https://github.com/puppetlabs/razor-client) is a small Ruby
script that makes interacting with the server from the command line
easier. It lets you explore what the server knows about your
infrastructure, and modify how machines are provisioned, by interacting
with the
[Razor server API](https://github.com/puppetlabs/razor-server/blob/master/doc/api.md)
